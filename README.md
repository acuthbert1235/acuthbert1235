- 👋 Hi, I’m @acuthbert1235
- 👀 I’m interested in learning how to code!  I'm hoping to improve my skills in multiple languages to learn how to make interesting applications, parse through datasets, and create algorithms for data interpretation.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning multiple languages including Python, R, and SQL.  Yes, I'm still a beginner.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that help develop my skills!  I'm still in the early stages of learning, so I'd be happy to contribute however I can.
